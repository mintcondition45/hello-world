# hello-world
My first repository

Hey all,
My name is Madison and I'm a 22 yr old college student who is currently studying CS at a community college in Texas. I like video games, particularly the racing genre as I suck at FPS games like Halo and COD. I also like to read technical books relating to Cybersecurity and Programming Languages. I'm currently reading a Kotlin programming book and looking to implement what I've learned through Github of course! I am hoping to connect with like-minded people on here who like to program in their spare time and who are looking to turn it into a career.
